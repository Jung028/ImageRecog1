# Image Recognition Code

This is a Python script for performing image recognition using computer vision techniques.

## Description

The image recognition code utilizes the OpenCV library to detect and classify objects in images or real-time video feeds. It supports the detection of faces, eyes, and smiles.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python


2. Clone the repository:


   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-recognition-code.git

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd image-recognition-code

4. Run the script:

    ```bash
   python3 image_recognition.py

6. This will start the image recognition process. You can provide the path to an image or use the webcam for real-time object detection.

The script will display the detected objects on the screen and provide relevant information.
